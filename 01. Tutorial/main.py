"""print(help(int))""" #change the variable type for info/help section
# The following command provides detailed documentation about the `int` class in Python.

# print(help(int))

# Overview:
# The `help(int)` command provides detailed documentation about the `int` class in Python.
# The `int` class represents integers, a fundamental data type in Python.
# When you pass `int` to the `help()` function, Python generates a help page that includes a
# comprehensive description of the `int` class, its methods, and how to use it.

# Detailed Explanation:

# 1. `help(int)`:
#    - The `help()` function is a built-in Python function that displays the help information for a given object.
#    - When `help(int)` is executed, Python displays a detailed help page for the `int` class, which includes the following sections:

#    1. **Class Information**:
#        - The documentation starts by identifying the object as the `int` class, showing that it is a built-in Python class.
#        - It explains that `int` is the type for immutable integers in Python.

#    2. **Constructor Details**:
#        - The help page describes how to create an integer. It shows the signature of the `int()` constructor:
#          ```python
#          class int(x=0) -> integer
#          class int(x, base=10) -> integer
#          ```
#        - It explains that the `int()` function can be used to create an integer from:
#          - An integer value (returns the same value).
#          - A floating-point number (truncates the decimal part).
#          - A string representing an integer (e.g., `int("42")` returns `42`).
#          - Another object that can be converted to an integer (using the object's `__int__()` method).
#          - It also explains how to convert a string in a specific base (like binary, hexadecimal) to an integer using the `base` parameter.

#    3. **Methods Overview**:
#        - The help page lists the methods available for the `int` class. These methods include:
#          - **Arithmetic Operations**: Methods like `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, `__truediv__`, etc., which define how integers interact with other numbers during arithmetic operations.
#          - **Conversion Methods**: Methods like `__int__`, `__float__`, `__str__`, which handle converting the integer to other types.
#          - **Utility Methods**: Methods like `bit_length()`, which returns the number of bits required to represent the integer in binary, `conjugate()`, which returns the complex conjugate (useful when dealing with complex numbers, but in `int`, it just returns the integer itself), and `to_bytes()`, which returns an array of bytes representing the integer.

#    4. **Special Methods**:
#        - The help page provides details on special methods that start and end with double underscores (`__`). These methods are often referred to as "dunder" methods and are used to define the behavior of `int` objects for built-in operations. For example:
#          - `__add__`: Handles the addition operation (`+`).
#          - `__sub__`: Handles the subtraction operation (`-`).
#          - `__eq__`: Handles equality comparison (`==`).
#        - These methods are usually not called directly, but are invoked by Python internally when you use operators or built-in functions on `int` objects.

#    5. **Attributes**:
#        - The `int` class has no custom attributes of its own, as it is a simple data type, but it inherits methods and properties from the base class `object`.

#    6. **Examples and Usage**:
#        - The documentation may include examples of how to use `int` and its methods, helping you understand how to effectively work with integers in Python.

# 2. `print()`:
#    - The `print()` function is used to display the output of the `help(int)` call in the console. Without `print()`, the help text would still appear, but in some interactive environments or scripts, explicitly printing the help text can be useful.
#    - The output is typically quite long, as it covers all aspects of the `int` class.

# Summary:
# The `print(help(int))` command is an excellent way to access and display the built-in documentation for the `int` class.
# This documentation covers everything from how to create and use integers to the methods and operations that are available for them.
# Itâ€™s a powerful tool for learning about the `int` type in Python, especially if you're new to the language or need a quick reference.

""""Summary of print(dir(fruits)) and print(help(fruits))"""
# Summary:
#
# 1. print(dir(fruits)):
#    - Lists all the attributes and methods associated with the `fruits` object.
#    - Useful for discovering what you can do with the `fruits` object, especially if you're not familiar with its type.
#
# 2. print(help(fruits)):
#    - Provides a detailed help page for the `fruits` object.
#    - Explains how to use the object, what methods it offers, and often gives examples.
#    - Essential for understanding the full capabilities of the object and how to utilize it effectively.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"""print(dir(fruits))"""
# The `dir()` function is used to find out which attributes (variables, methods, etc.)
# are associated with an object. It returns a list of all the valid attributes
# (including methods) that the object `fruits` has. This is particularly useful
# when you want to explore an object to see what functionality is available.

# For example, if `fruits` is a list, `dir(fruits)` will return a list of methods
# and attributes like 'append', 'remove', 'pop', etc.

"""print(help(fruits))"""
# The `help()` function is a built-in function that provides an interactive help system.
# When called with an object as an argument, it displays detailed documentation about that object.
# This includes:
# - A brief description of the object
# - The methods and attributes available
# - Details on how to use those methods and attributes
# - Information on the class or type of the object, if available

# For example, if `fruits` is a list, `help(fruits)` will show the documentation
# on how to use a list in Python, including method descriptions, example usage,
# and more. It's a great way to learn about the object directly from within
# the Python interpreter.
