x = 3.14
y = 4

# result = round(x)
    # result is a variable
    # round is a function
# result = abs(y)
    # abs value function is used to find the absolute value of a number.
    # Is the distance from 0 as a whole number
# result = pow(y, 3)
    # pow = is consisted of a base and an exponent. It can raise a base to a given power.
    # In the example, base = Y (4), 3 is the exponent.
# result = max(x,y,z)
    # maximum value
# result = min(x,y,z)
    # minimum value
